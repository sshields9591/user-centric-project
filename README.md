Stream One Project: User Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is essentially my resume of previous and current jobs that I have had and my current studies with Code Institute.

## UX
My goals in the design of this page was to make information accessible, while keeping a minimal and simple design.

## Technologies
1. HTML
2. CSS
3. BOOTSRAP

## Features
This webpage features a dropdown menu that allows you to get to different parts of the webpage quickly.

## Testing
I manually tested functions of this webpage using the mobile-first design and working my way up to desktop.

## Deployment
The live site is deployed on GitHub Pages. It uses the master branch and is updated each time there is a new push to the repository.x

## Credits
### Content
The text in the "About Me" and "Work" sections were written by me.

## Media
All photos were taken from https://www.pexels.com, a free stock image library.

## Acknowledgements
I received inspiration for this project from the source material that was offered. It was similar to previous projects that the course has had us perform and allowd me to creat a webpage as a resume.
